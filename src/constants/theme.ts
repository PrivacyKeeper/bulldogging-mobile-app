 *
 * Deliberately separate from `app.eventType` below, which is the app's own
 * slug and does not match the database ("tiedown" vs "tie_down_roping").
 * Reusing the slug as a filter silently matched nothing: the query succeeded,
 * the screen said the producer was not running this event, and there was no
 * error anywhere to notice.
 *
 * A list because the mapping is genuinely one-to-many, and the entries are NOT
 * interchangeable. Heading and heeling are two ends of the same run and a
 * roper does one of them; steer wrestling and chute dogging are different
 * events with different rules; ranch rodeo is a whole card. Filing every run
 * under the first code turned a heeler into a header and collapsed ten ranch
 * events into one.
 *
 * `resultKind` is per event because it genuinely varies within a card:
 * roughstock is two judges marking the horse and the rider out of 25 each,
 * where the eight seconds is a pass/fail gate rather than the result, and
 * everything else is on the clock.
